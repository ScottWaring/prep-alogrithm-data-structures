Each element points to the next element in line, the group of elements, aka nodes, creates a sequence, each node is data and a reference, allows efficient insertion and removal from any position during iteration, access time is linear and cannot be increased.

Similar to arrays, but elements do not have index value, no random access. To get to element in linked list you start at the head (front) and move thru the elements till arriving at the desired element

Each element has data, and a reference to the next element in the list,
