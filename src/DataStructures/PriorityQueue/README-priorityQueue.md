Similar to a queue, element is assigned a priority value, and the order of the queue is determined by the priority value of the object, higher priority values are higher in order and returned first. As opposed to 'First In First Out' as a normal queue operates, the priority queue is 'Higher Order Is First Out'. Elements of the same priority are removed in the order they were added in.
